# decentralizedDebtProtocol

Improvements to the dDebt protocol proposal by greymatter capital.


Directly quoted from the papar's abstract, "The introduction of cash flow generating decentralized financial protocols enables the formation of a decentralized debt market. With cash flows that resemble those of traditional businesses, decentralized protocols now have the option to secure financing outside of token sales by establishing lender confidence with predictable paths toward repayment. Here in, we out line the protocol for a decentralized debt market that allows decentralized protocols to issue undercollateralized debt in the form of unsecured loans that can be freely traded in secondary markets. Overtime, as in traditional financial markets, it is probable that the decentralized debt market will become the predominant means of raising capital to fund long-term protocol development."
